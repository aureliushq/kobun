### Introduction

Data structures are fundamental to computer science, enabling efficient storage and manipulation of data. This guide explores the most common types of data structures, their uses, and how they optimize operations.

### Types of Data Structures

1. **Arrays**: Simple lists for storing collections of elements.
2. **Linked Lists**: Linear data structures where each node points to the next.
3. **Stacks**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures commonly used with pushing and popping operations.

### Operations on Data Structures

- Insertion, deletion, and searching are common operations supported by most structures.
- The choice of data structure depends on performance requirements.

### Conclusion

Understanding data structures is crucial for software development. By mastering these fundamentals, you can optimize your algorithms and build more efficient systems.
